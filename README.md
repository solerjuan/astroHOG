AstroHOG
==================================

AstroHOG is set of tools for the comparison of extended spectral-line observations (PPV cubes).
In essence, the histrogram of oriented gradients (HOG) technique takes as input two PPV cubes and provides an estimate of their spatial correlation across velocity channels.
